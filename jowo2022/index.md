## Energy and Sustainability Ontology (Ensusto) Workshop 2022

## About Ensusto

The Energy and Sustainability Ontology (Ensusto) Workshop 2022 is part of [JOWO 2022](https://www.iaoa.org/jowo/2022/index.html), which is held at Jönköping University August 15-19, 2022. The workshop is a venue for presenting ontologies and the application of ontologies, which are related to topics that are relevant in the context of renewable energies and substainability. 


## Scope

The scope of the workshop includes any ontology and any application of an ontology related to renewable energy and sustainability. This includes (but is not limited to): 
* Energy systems 
* Climate 
* Ecosystems 
* Human socioeconomic impacts and preventative behaviours on the environment 
* Mitigation of the effects of climate change 


## Submissions 

Submissions should be at least 5 pages and at most 10 pages. 

Papers should be submitted non-anonymously in PDF format in compliance with the new 1-column CEUR-ART Style. Templates are available [here](./CEURART.zip), more information is available at [CEUR](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/). 

Papers are submitted via Easychair. The Easychair submission page can be found at [JOWO-Easychair-Submission](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=jowo2022) (select the track “ Energy and Sustainability Ontology Workshop”).

All accepted papers will be published as part of a joint JOWO proceedings volume at CEUR. (Previous JOWO proceedings are availble here: [JOWO 2018](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2205/),  [JOWO 2019](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2518/), [JOWO 2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2708/)).


## Evaluation Criteria

Papers in this track should be related to (1) a novel ontology for the domain of energy and sustainability or (2) systems and methods related that utilise ontologies a meaningful way in reasearch or applications related to topics of renewable energy or sustainability.  

(1) Publications that focus on a specific ontology must provide additional value that enables a reader to
understand the represented domain and specific design decisions. These publications should address the following points:

* A clear description of the domain and scope of the ontology or system
* Unique challenges and requirements that the domain and possible use-cases entail
* Methodologies and design choices that have been employed to address these challenges
* Potential applications

(2) For system-focused submissions, the submissions should include 
* A clear discussion of the use case of the system or method  
* A discussion in which ways the semantic properties of the ontology enhance the system and aid its intended use-cases
* Either an evaluation of the performance or -- in the case of preliminary work -- a discussion how the authors intend to evaluate the performance of the system or methodology  

Reviews will consider the novelty, significance and soundness of the respective ontology or system regarding the points discussed above.
