## About Ensusto

Energy, and sustainability more broadly, are increasingly relevant topics in the context of the climate crisis and a rapidly changing world, 
around which data and research needs to be aggregated. Topics that will be within scope of the proposed workshop include energy systems, 
sustainability, climate, ecosystems, and associated human socioeconomic impacts and preventative behaviours, including approaches to 
sustainable development. The workshop will focus on the development of ontologies for these domains as well as applications in which 
such ontologies are used.

## Scope

Papers in this track should be related to a novel ontology for the domain of energy and sustainability or systems and methods related to the creation,
evaluation or application of such ontologies. Publications that focus on a specific ontology must provide additional value that enables a reader to
understand the represented domain and specific design decisions. These publications should address the following points:

* A clear description of the domain and scope of the ontology or system
* Unique challenges and requirements that the domain and possible use-cases entail
* Methodologies and design choices that have been employed to address these challenges
* Potential applications

The usage of an ontology in system-focused submissions should exeed that of a mere taxonomy. These submissions should emphasise how the semantic properties
of the ontology enhance the system and aid its intended applications.
