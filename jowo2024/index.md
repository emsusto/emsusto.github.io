## Energy, Materials and Sustainability Ontology (Emsusto) Workshop 2024

## About Emsusto

The Energy, Materials and Sustainability Ontology (Emsusto) Workshop 2024 is part of [JOWO 2024](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/fois2024/workshops/), which is held at University of Twente 15-19 July 2024. It provides a venue for presenting ontologies and their applications in the domains of renewable energy, materials and sustainability. The primary goal of this workshop is to offer researchers and practitioners in these domains an opportunity to meet and exchange experiences in developing and using ontologies, and to provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge and best practices for ontologies in these domains. We welcome participation also from those who have just started to apply ontologies in these domains or who are are not yet using ontologies in these domains but are interested in learning more.
  


## Scope

The scope of the workshop includes any ontology and any application of an ontology related to renewable energy and sustainability. This includes (but is not limited to): 
* Energy systems 
* Climate 
* Ecosystems 
* Human socioeconomic impacts and preventative behaviours on the environment
* Mitigation of the effects of climate change
* Materials, including their development, characterisation and environmental impacts


## Submissions

Submissions should be at least 5 pages and at most 9 pages.

Papers should be submitted non-anonymously in PDF format in compliance with the new 1-column CEUR-ART Style. Templates and more information are available [here](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html).

Papers are submitted via Easychair. The Easychair submission page can be found at [JOWO-Easychair-Submission](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=jowo2024) (select the track “ Energy and Sustainability Ontology Workshop”).

All accepted papers will be published as part of a joint JOWO proceedings volume at CEUR. (Previous JOWO proceedings are availble here: [JOWO 2019](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2518/), [JOWO 2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2708/), [JOWO 2021](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2969/), [JOWO 2022](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3249/)).


## Evaluation Criteria

Papers for this workshop should be related to (1) a novel ontology for the domain of energy, materials or sustainability or (2) systems and related methods that use ontologies a meaningful way in reasearch or applications related to topics of renewable energy, materials or sustainability.  

(1) Publications that focus on a specific ontology must provide additional value that enables a reader to
understand the represented domain and specific design decisions. These publications should address the following points:

* A clear description of the domain and scope of the ontology or system
* Unique challenges and requirements that the domain and possible use-cases entail
* Methodologies and design choices that have been employed to address these challenges
* Potential applications

(2) For system-focused submissions, the submissions should include 
* A clear discussion of the use case of the system or method  
* A discussion in which ways the semantic properties of the ontology enhance the system and aid its intended use-cases
* Either an evaluation of the performance or -- in the case of preliminary work -- a discussion how the authors intend to evaluate the performance of the system or methodology  

Reviews will consider the novelty, significance and soundness of the respective ontology or system regarding the points discussed above. All ontologies that are discussed in these publications should be publicly available.
