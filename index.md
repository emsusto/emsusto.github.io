## <ins>En</ins>ergy and <ins>Sus</ins>tainability On<ins>to</ins>logy Workshop Proposal

Energy, and sustainability more broadly, are increasingly relevant topics in the context of the climate crisis and a rapidly changing world, around which data and research needs to be aggregated. Topics that will be within scope of the proposed workshop include energy systems, sustainability, climate, ecosystems, and associated human socioeconomic impacts and preventative behaviours, including approaches to sustainable development. The workshop will focus on the development of ontologies for these domains as well as applications in which such ontologies are used.
