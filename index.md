## <ins>En</ins>ergy, Materials and <ins>Sust</ins>ainability <ins>O</ins>ntology Workshop

Energy, materials, and sustainability are increasingly relevant topics in the context of the climate crisis and a rapidly changing world, around which data and research needs to be aggregated. Topics that are within scope of this workshop series include energy systems, sustainability, climate, ecosystems, materials, and associated human socioeconomic impacts and preventative behaviours, including approaches to sustainable development. The workshop will focus on the development of ontologies for these domains as well as applications in which such ontologies are used.
